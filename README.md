## Title:
Towards Human-Centered Co-Creation between Humans and AI: A Three-Level Adjustment Framework for Effective Collaboration

## Keywords:
Human-AI co-creation, human-centered, collaboration

## Abstract:
Even though many aspects of the human creation process remain mysterious, with the advancement in AI technology, various intelligent creativity support systems like DALL·E and Stable Diffusion have emerged (Frich et al. 2019) and give assistance to humans in the creative process as co-creators (Gmeiner, Holstein, and Martelaro 2022).

While AI-based co-creation systems have shown great promise in facilitating creative works, the black box nature of AI models and algorithms imposes a high cognitive load on users when trying to anticipate and comprehend the decision-making process and output delivered by AI. Additionally, individuals hold different preferences on interaction styles in terms of AI involvement in different use cases (Schulz, Kratzer, and Toussaint 2018), yet the role of AI in the co-creation process is often ambiguous and limited by the singular functionality of existing tools (Hwang 2022). Also, as AI takes increasing agency in creative works, it may cause risks of undermining humans’ self-efficacy in collaboration (Hwang 2022). 

It is still unclear how AI-based creativity-supporting systems could tailor to human needs and expectations. To tackle this challenge, this study intends to explore a human-AI co-creation framework to optimize the user experience and enhance the creative outcome generation. The framework proposes the involvement of AI in three classified levels of creation and allows humans to adjust between the levels anytime during the creative process based on their preference. A user interface is provided to ensure transparency throughout the process.

With the question of “How AI should be involved in terms of collaboration in each of the three levels during the creative process?”, the team has built a Human-AI co-creation system to support humans in creating sculpture as case study. This system has three key components: prompt-based AI model (DALL·E 2), advanced computer vision, and robotic arms for physical implementation. The involvement of AI in this system is classified into three levels: (1) level 1 with the least AI involvement to assist outcome execution, (2) level 2 with mediate AI involvement to collaborate with human in idea generation based on requirements inputted, and (3) level 3 with the highest AI involvement to generate operational outputs base on goals provided by humans. This case study also includes a series of validation experiments, where 31 professional sculptors were recruited to create sculptures with the proposed system that enable adjusting the level of AI involvement and systems with fixed AI involvement levels. The effectiveness of the co-creation systems is evaluated by the Creativity Support Index(Carroll et al. 2009), which is a standardized measurement tool for evaluating creativity support. 

Results show that co-creation process between humans and AI can be optimized by allowing for adjustment of the levels of AI involvement at different stages and based on specific needs. This enables humans to maintain control over the role that AI plays in the creative process, ensuring that the outcome aligns with their expectations. A user interface that facilitates transparency can be highly beneficial for understanding the output and decision-making of AI, which helps to build trust in the overall process. In this way, the overall user experience can be enhanced, leading to more creative outcomes.
